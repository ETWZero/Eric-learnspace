原文来自https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/15355/resources-for-blender



Since asking for tutorials, videos, resources, links to other content or downloads is considered off topic here, this is a specifically created Community Wiki which gathers resources for Blender and it has been approved by the [Community](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/410/should-we-have-a-few-questions-on-resources-for-use-with-blender).

Just write in the appropriate answer/section. If you have concerns, questions, post a [meta](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/) question, so we don't clutter the comments, but you can link your meta question from the comments.

Questions regarding such resources are not allowed anymore, except for very specific and on topic requests (ask on [Meta](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/) if you're unsure about your question). Follow the instructions made in the question about how to post, what can be posted, etc.
